## What is EXCALIBUR?

Excalibur is an shortcuts script for Visual Studio Code!
In there you can write own shortcut script for any language you want, like that here.
This project is giving you faster HTML typing speed, by using some usefull shortcuts. This script is best for students or people always must write on the same shema!

## Quickstart

To use this script use following steps!

1. download the folder with the file in it named `.vscode`

2. open your Visual Studio Code and press following shortcut on keyboard:

    ```shell
    STRG + P
    ```

    or if you don't have an `STRG`, press following combination:

    ```shell
    CTRL + P
    ```

     Then if there is no `>` in before, type that in, and you should see a lots of new text. Type:

    ```shell
    Preferences: Code Extensions >
    ``` 

    and then Enter. 

    Last steps are typing `html.json` and copying the shortcut script!

3. Done!

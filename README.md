## What is EXCALIBUR?

Excalibur is a shortcut script for Visual Studio Code!
In there, you can write your own shortcut script for any language you want, like this one here.
This project increases your HTML typing speed by using useful shortcuts.
This script is best for students or people who always have to write in the same schema!


## Quickstart

To use this script use following steps!

1. download the folder with the file in it named `.vscode`

2. open your Visual Studio Code and press following shortcut on keyboard:

    ```shell
    STRG + P
    ```

    or if you don't have an `STRG`, press following combination:

    ```shell
    CTRL + P
    ```

     Then if there is no `>` before, type that in, and you should see a lots of new text. Type:

    ```shell
    Preferences: Code Extensions >
    ``` 

    and then Enter. 

    Last steps are typing `html.json`, Enter, and `STRG + V` or `CTRL + V` your copied test!

4. Done!
